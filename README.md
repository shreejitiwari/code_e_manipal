The problem MediRush solves
Healthcare systems in our country have common problems such as long waiting lines of patients at hospitals, poorly managed appointment, and unavailability of doctors in critical situations.

Patients are not always able to find nearby specialists/professionals (specific to their case) who are available, leading to delays in receiving critical care.

Hospital systems often have long paper work procedure and are difficult for patients to navigate, all this leads to delays in appointment and treatment.
